\begin{abstract}
Blockchain as a technology provides two major properties that are highly desirable in applications like election voting. Those properties are immutability which ensures that no one can modify the data once wrote into a blockchain, there might be concerns if this property is truly desirable for everyone, but I assume this system is designed for healthy subjects. Another property is transparency that allows everyone to validates the election correctness and calculate results on its own. In consequences, one can distrust authorities, while trust voting resultThe abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in
15--250 words.

\section{IntroduFirst Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Blockchain initially introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin Whitepaper offered one simple application, i.e. ledger for transferring Bitcoin cryptocurrency. 5 years later Vitalik Buterin proposed generalization to this concept by allowing to process not only transactions but also so-called smart contracts which are in fact scripts run on Ethereum platform. Those “scripts” are executed and validated by all Ethereum nodes and use blockchain as persistent storage. This innovation allowed to create domain-specific behavior on top of Ethereum blockchain, leveragingPlease note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, already existing infrastructure indented.

\subsection{Tokenization}
Currently, the most popular application of smart contracts is token issuance. Those tokens can represent any arbitrary asset either in the virtual or physical world. One can create tokens for funding his startup; hence token represent company shares. This pattern is called ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or STO (Security Token Offering), alluding to IPO (Initial Public Offering). Another one can issue tokens backed by a physical asset like national currency; bypassing slow and expensive international transfers and taxes from exchanging cryptocurrencies with national currencies. This pattern is called Stable Coin. There are many other token applications particularly vote as a token used here in this survey.

\subsection{Stellar platform}
Ethereum provides high flexibility, mainly because of its fully-fledged smart contracts ecosystem, particularly it’s Turing-complete Solidity language. Stellar on the other hand is a blockchain platform specializing just in one application that is asset tokenization. Thus becoming easier, cheaper and faster than general-purpose Ethereum smart contracts. Here I will try to fit this simple election system into Stellar functionality boundaries.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
